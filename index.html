        <h1>Afroman is coming to town...</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            You better not 'pout, you better not shout<br>
            I slap your grandmomma's dentures out<br>
            Afroman is coming to town
            <br>
            <br>
            Slapping her once, I'm slapping her twice<br>
            A no-teeth blowjob feels real nice<br>
            Afroman is coming to town
            <br>
            <br>
            I know that you've been smoking all my tumble weed<br>
            I looked into my dub sack all I seen was stems and seeds<br>
            You better get dressed, hit the door<br>
            Go to the dub spot and buy some mo'<br>
            Afroman is coming to town
            <br>
            <br>
            All kinda states, all kinda cities<br>
            All kinda women yelling "Sign my titties"<br>
            Afroman is coming to town
            <br>
            <br>
            All the ladies in the crowd givin' me hugs<br>
            And all the fellas givin' me nugs<br>
            Afroman is coming to town
            <br>
            <br>
            The cops always know there's drugs at the show<br>
            Before they get to the stage, I smoke up all the draw<br>
            Oh read me my rights, take me to jail<br>
            The weeds all gone and I'm high as hell<br>
            Afroman is coming to town
        </p>
